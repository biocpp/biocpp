# The BioC++ libraries

Welcome to BioC++!

All source code can be found in the individual code repositories:

 * [Core library](https://github.com/biocpp/biocpp-core): provides Alphabets, Ranges and Metaprogramming utilities.
 * [I/O library](https://github.com/biocpp/biocpp-io): provides abstractions for reading/writing TXT, CSV, FastA, FastQ, VCF, BCF, â€¦
 * more are planned!

This repository contains various resources that are shared between different BioC++ libraries and general, project-wide documentation.
